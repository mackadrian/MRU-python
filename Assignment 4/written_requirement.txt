1. 

The two challenges that the format of the building file presented are: it was difficult 
to process the building if it was only read once, and how to format the building in a way
it can be used to calculate the score of the dice. Just using the .read() method was not enough.
When we used an echo print, we saw that it only printed by line. To get the elements in
the lines we needed to find a way to split it again so we can get the element in the array.
We used the indices and used that to create our list of lists. 
This made the calculations a little less tedious to do.

2. 

An alternative file format that would not pose the challenges provided is a CSV file. If we were to 
use a CSV or comma-seperated values file, we could import the CSV module from the Python library.
This would give us access to methods that can only be used when importing the CSV module.
Formatting would be much more cleaner, and will use less lines.

3.

A different challenge that a CSV file format would pose is it can not handle complex data very well.
To make matters more tedious, if we only want the output as a .txt file format, we would have to
translate it from CSV to .TXT and vice versa.
