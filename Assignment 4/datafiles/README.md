# About the datafiles folder

This folder currently holds 2 things:

1. This README, and
2. A file called `building.txt` that holds text representing a building to be scored by your program. The current building is composed of 2 stacks of glass.

You'll probably want to test your program out with a variety of different buildings, so feel free to put files representing them in here as well. Just remember, you'll need to rename the file you're testing to `building.txt`!
